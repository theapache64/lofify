lofify /path/to/your/video.mp4
```

### Replace Original Audio

To completely replace the original audio with lofi music:

## Prerequisites

Before installing Lofify, make sure you have the following dependencies:

- **ffmpeg**: Required for audio/video processing
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
  - Other systems: Visit [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

- **bc**: Required for floating-point calculations
  - macOS: `brew install bc`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install bc`

## Quick Installation

Install Lofify with a single command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theapache64/lofify/master/install.sh | bash
```

or

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theapache64/lofify/master/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- Install the Lofify script to your `~/bin` directory
- Set up sample lofi audio files in `~/lofi_audios`
- Add `~/bin` to your PATH (if not already there)

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to make the command available in your current session.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theapache64/lofify.git
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x lofify.sh
   ```

3. Move the script to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   cp lofify.sh ~/bin/lofify
   ```

4. Create a directory for lofi audio files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/lofi_audios
   ```

5. Copy the sample lofi audio files:
   ```bash
   cp -r lofi_audios/* ~/lofi_audios/
   ```

6. Add `~/bin` to your PATH (if not already there):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```


## Adding Your Own Lofi Tracks

To add your own lofi tracks:

1. Place your audio files (MP3, WAV, or OGG format) in the `~/lofi_audios` directory:
   ```bash
   cp your_lofi_track.mp3 ~/lofi_audios/
   ```

2. That's it! Lofify will now include your tracks in the random selection.

## Examples

### Add lofi background to a screen recording:

```bash
lofify ~/Desktop/screen_recording.mp4
```

### Replace audio in a tutorial video:

```bash
lofify ~/Videos/tutorial.mp4 -r
```
